        <p>This website I have made was made during the 7-8 weeks I was in the Devcamp class during the summer of 2017. Having the opportunity to learn coding and be given an opportunity to something I could've never dreamed of is absolutely phenomenal.</p>

        <p>Ruby on Rails is a fantastic coding base and is very simplistic to use, perfect in my case. I suggest that anyone who is new to coding to use it, because it really throws you in and helps you learn a lot.</p>
